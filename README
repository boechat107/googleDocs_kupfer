# Google Docs plugin for Kupfer

[Kupfer](http://kaizer.se/wiki/kupfer/) is a application launcher, simple and powerfull. Like Gnome-Do, Kupfer give to us a
convenient and fast way to launch a application or find a document. Both are very
extendable with plugins, which made them indispensable after a some time of use.
To add a functionallity already present with Gnome-Do, I wrote a simple Kupfer plugin to
retrieve the documents from a Google account. Currently, the plugin has just one
functionality, retrieve the documents and open them with the default browser. 

## Installation

Just put the googleDocs.py into the folder ~/.local/share/kupfer/plugins.
